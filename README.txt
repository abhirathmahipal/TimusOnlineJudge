I've made this repository to upload my solutions to problems by Timus Online Judge

The file is named after the problem number on Timus.

The solution to http://acm.timus.ru/problem.aspx?space=1&num=1005, would be in a file named 1005.extension
I've tried to document and comment everything possible.

I haven't solved stuff all by myself. I've read the discussion board in case I couldn't solve the problem and have Googled concepts as well. 

I'm new to programming and I'm sure that my solutions aren't the best.
If you find better solutions, please let me know via Twitter, Linkedin or Quora.
